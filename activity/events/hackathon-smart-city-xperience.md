## Proposal for « Smart City Xperience » Hackathon by Open Geneva [2023]

**[Draft, not submitted]**

[Open Geneva](https://opengeneva.org/) sets up a [24-hour hackathon on smart cities](https://scx23.sparkboard.com/)
hosted by a higher education establishment ([HEG](https://www.hesge.ch/heg/en)). The idea is to submit a challenge
around this topic of smart cities while linking it to open models education (see
[coalition](https://github.com/Open-Models/ngi-coalition)).

A way of exploring the relationship between science and society in this work around open models.

### Smart city, open institutions and knowledge. How can science and education enlighten society?

The aim would be to imagine what a "smart city" might look like in the light of these dynamics of openness around
knowledge that are taking shape with digital.

A discussion to feed the strategy around the « [Brick of Knowledge on Open Models](https://open-models.org/) » in
this work of implementing training within universities (and organisations). An opportunity to also seek to advance
open models education within different organisations, including the host structure and open geneva.

As these are complex subjects which shouldn't be revolutionized in 24 hours and because we're doing education, the
aim will also be to make it a learning experience for participants, in terms of open models, science, education, etc.
that can contribute to the open geneva hackathon framework (see hack the hackathon in resources).

**A hackathon for advancing the « Brick of Knowledge » through citizen debate, a learning time for hackathon attendees
while seeking to improve links with organisations for open models education.**
